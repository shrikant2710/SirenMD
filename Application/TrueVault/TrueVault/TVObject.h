Simply declare properties as you would on any other NSObject subclass, and those that are of type NSString, NSNumber or NSDate will be saved upon calling the saveWithCompletionHandler: method.

By default properties are not indexed and thus cannot be part of a TVQuery search. Simply modify your property to conform to <TVIndexed> for it to be indexed and thus searchable.
